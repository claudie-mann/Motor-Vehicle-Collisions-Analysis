# Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyse motor vehicle collision data across New York City to identify dangerous locations, common causes of crashes, and opportunities for improving road safety. The dataset includes crash dates/times, locations, boroughs, vehicle types, injuries/fatalities, and contributing factors. This is real open data collected by the NYPD.

Which boroughs, streets, or intersections are the most dangerous?

What are the leading causes of crashes, and do they vary by borough?
